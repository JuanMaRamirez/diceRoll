A dice roll Game

A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor 
factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; 
they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. 
One typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice 
are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice.
